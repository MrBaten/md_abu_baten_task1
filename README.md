1. I am currently working on machine learning. I have done basic work with django before. As a result, I tried to complete the task that was given to me. I am submitting as much as I have done
2. The first problem I found was with the database connection. Then again when I went to show the chart I got the problem. I have a problem with the chart. The chart doesn't appear when the machine or environment changes, which I haven't been able to resolve. Then again when I went to host on the free server I got the problem again. Having problems with wsgi and gunicorn. I was using render as free hosting. I found those problems and I'm willing best try to solve those problems.

thank you!
